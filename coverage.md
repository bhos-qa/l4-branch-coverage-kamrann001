# CODE COVERAGE
Code coverage is a kind of a metric that is used to determine how much of the actual source code is tested. It is often needed to evaluate the quality of the testing process.
There are different kinds of coverage techniques used that I learned during lectures.
## Statement coverage
Covering all potential pathways, lines, and statements in source code is the primary goal of statement coverage.
On the basis of the structure of the code, a scenario is derived using statement coverage. This is a white-box testing technique.

## Branch Coverage

All branches of the control flow graph are covered using the branch coverage technique. Each condition of the decision point is covered at least once. This white box testing technique makes sure that each branch of every decision point must be executed.

## Condition coverage

A testing technique used to test and assess the variables or sub-expressions in the conditional statement is called condition or predicate coverage.Aim of condition coverage is checking individual outcomes for each logical condition. Condition coverage is usually more sensitive to the control flow.
